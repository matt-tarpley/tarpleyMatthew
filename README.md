🚀 About Me

Im Matt Tarpley, a full stack web and cross-platform mobile developer specializing in ASP.NET Core, .NET MAUI, and SQL Server/T-SQL.

💡Although C# and .NET have a special place in my heart, Im always eager to learn new technology and expand my knowledge base! I'm 
also well-versed in a variety of technologies including JavaScript, JS frameworks and libraries (jQuery, React, Vue), Node.js, Python, 
and different relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.

🎓 I recently graduated with an Associate's in Software Development and am currently working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

👨‍👧‍👦 Outside of the tech world, I'm a proud father who enjoys spending quality time with family.

🎸 I have a passion for playing guitar, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, watching sports, and reading books that my wife finds boring 😄.
